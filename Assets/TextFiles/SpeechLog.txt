We present deck talk a virtual reality app that enables users to practice giving talks in virtualized environments to an interactable AI powered audience.
Presentation it's common in both academic and professional settings
To refine the presentation people often practice giving talks in front of a wall or mirror
Where are limited amount of feedback can be obtained
How can we make practice talks more effective and closer to real life?
We designed deck talk based on three core concepts.
First the user should be able to choose from a diverse set of environments to give toxin
Second
We are just taking virtual avatars should be present in the scene.
To mimic real audiences.
Third the user should be able to interact with the audience via question answering and receive feedback about the presentation
The company virtual speech has developed a similar application with virtual reality and AI.
Including varied Workplace settings
Virtual Interactable avatars. And AI generated ratings.
However, virtual speech requires the conversion of presentation sites into PDFs
And it costs $400 a year
In contrast we allow users to bring the presentation into the virtual environment
The web browser and are planning to offer the app for free by open sourcing the code.
In addition our app enables users to improve their general presentation skills by practicing against AI generated presentation sides.
